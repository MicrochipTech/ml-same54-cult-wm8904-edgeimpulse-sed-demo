# Custom Processing Blocks
This directory contains the code to host a server for extracting LogMFE and LogSpectrogram features with Edge Impulse Studio. The details are further explained in the sound recognition tutorial on [microchip developer](https://microchipdeveloper.com/machine-learning:soundrecognition-with-edge-impulse).

Follow [this guide](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/custom-blocks) for instructions on how to integrate this code into Edge Impulse Studio as custom processing blocks.

Note this code is a fork of the official processing blocks maintained by Edge Impulse at [this repository](https://github.com/edgeimpulse/processing-blocks).
